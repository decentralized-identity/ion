## Why is bitcoin chosen as the blockchain?

While ledger-based consensus systems, on the surface, would seem to provide the same general features as one another, there are a few key differences that make some more suitable for critical applications, like the decentralized identifiers of human beings. Some of these considerations and features are:

1. The system must be open and permissionless, not a cabal of authorities who can exclude and remove participants.

1. The system must be well-tested, and proven secure against attack over a long enough duration to be confident in.

1. The system must produce a singular, independently verifiable record that is as immutable as possible, so that reversing the record the system produces is infeasible.

1. The system must be widely deployed, with nodes that span the globe, to ensure the record is persisted.

1. The system must be self-incentivized, so that nodes continue to operate, process, and secure the record over time. The value from operation must come from the system directly, because outside incentive reliance is itself a vector for attack.

1. The cost to attack the system through any game theoretically available means must be high enough that it is infeasible to attempt, and even if an ultra-capitalized attacker did, it would require a weaponized mobilization of force and resources that would be obvious, with options for mitigation.

The outcome:

- #1 eliminates private and permissioned ledgers

- #2 eliminates just about all other ledgers and blockchains, simply because they are inadequately tested

- For the metrics detailed in #3-#6, Bitcoin is so far beyond all other options, it isn't even close - Bitcoin is the most secure option by an absurdly large margin.
