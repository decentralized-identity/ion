# ION Installation Guide

ION is a decentralized Layer 2 network for Decentralized Identifiers that runs atop the Bitcoin blockchain. Running an ION node minimizes trust in external parties for resolving ION DIDs, helps make the network more resilient and reliable, and provides the operator with better DID resolution performance.

The ION node reference implementation is currently in beta phase, operators should expect potential breaking changes and resets of the network's state. Presently, we are only recommending that experienced developers invest the time in running, testing, and contributing to the code base. This recommendation will change as the implementation progresses into more stable stages of development, which contributors will communicate to the community via blog posts and communications from DIF and collaborating organizations.

The ION node implementation is composed of a collection of microservices. Of these components, the major dependencies are Bitcoin Core, IPFS, and MongoDB (for local persistence of data).

## 1. Preparing your development environment

### Hardware

We recommend you run ION on a machine with the following minimum specs:

- i5 processor (2017+ models)
- 6GB of RAM
- 1TB of storage

### Operating System

Both Linux and Windows are supported and tested. For Linux, the setup is verified on Ubuntu 18, so we recommend Debian-based distros for Linux setup.

#### Linux Environment Setup

##### Snap

We use snap to simplify installation of certain services. Run the following command to install snap:
```
sudo apt install snapd
```

You may need to add the snap binaries directory to your path by adding the following line in ~/.bash_profile
```
PATH="$PATH:/snap/bin"
```

To ensure that the path changes go into effect immediately:
```
source ~/.bash_profile
```

##### Node.js

Services within ION rely on Node.js version 14. Run the following command to install Node v14:
```
sudo snap install node --classic --channel=14
```

##### build-essential

Building ION requires your distro's equivalent of Ubuntu's 'build-essential', e.g. make, g++, etc.
```
sudo apt install build-essential
```


#### Windows Environment Setup

Go go https://nodejs.org, download and install the latest v14 of Node.js.

### Inbound Ports to Open

If you wish to run a node that writes ION DID operations, you will need to enable uPnP on your router or open ports `4002` and `4003` so that the operation data files can be served to others via IPFS.

### Testnet or Mainnet

> NOTE: This guide describes steps to setup an ION node targeting bitcoin testnet, but can be used to target the bitcoin mainnet by substituting testnet configs for mainnet.

Bitcoin and ION need to be configured to use either `testnet` (for development) or `mainnet` (for production). If you change one service from `testnet` to `mainnet` or vice versa, the other services will also need to be rebuilt to match. Default config values for `testnet` are not valid for `mainnet` and services will fail to start if they are mismatched.

## 2. Setting up Bitcoin Core

An ION node needs a trusted Bitcoin peer for fetching and writing ION transactions. We use Bitcoin Core for this.

### Automated script for installing Bitcoin Core on Linux

If you would like to install and start Bitcoin Core automatically on Linux, you can review and run the automated script committed in the [Sidetree repo](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/sidetree/blob/master/lib/bitcoin/setup.sh).

> NOTE: Initial synchronization takes ~2 hours for testnet on a 2 core machine with an SSD.

### Installing Bitcoin Core Manually

You can find Windows and Linux binaries for Bitcoin Core releases [here.](https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/)

#### On Linux:

Create a configuration file (`bitcoin.conf`) designating 
1. the path you would like the Bitcoin data to be stored in (the `[datadir]`)
2. a username (e.g. `admin`)
3. a password (must match `ion-bitcoin`'s configuration later)

<table>
<tr>
<th>Testnet</th>
<th>Mainnet</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```yaml
testnet=1
server=1
datadir=~/.bitcoin
rpcuser=<your-rpc-username>
rpcpassword=<your-rpc-password>
txindex=1
```

</td>
<td>

```yaml
server=1
txindex=1
datadir=~/.bitcoin
rpcuser=<your-rpc-username>
rpcpassword=<your-rpc-password>
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

Start Bitcoin Core and let it sync:

```
./bin/bitcoind --config bitcoin.conf
```

> NOTE: You can add `--daemon` to run bitcoind as a daemon process.

#### On Windows:

Running Bitcoin Core with friendly UI after install:

```
bitcoin-qt.exe -testnet -datadir=<path-to-store-data> -server -rpcuser=<your-rpc-username> -rpcpassword=<your-rpc-password> -txindex=1
```


## 3. Installing Go-IPFS

Follow the instruction found at [IPFS website](https://docs.ipfs.io/install/) to install Go-IPFS, you can install the IPFS Desktop which internally installs Go-IPFS, it provides you with a user friendly UI.

## 4. Setting up MongoDB

### On Linux:

The default persistence option for storing data locally is MongoDB, though it is possible to create adapters for other datastores. To use the default MongoDB option, you'll need to install MongoDB community build:

- Download as a `deb` package: https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community.
- Installation doc: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/

> NOTE: You may not have all the dependencies required to run MongoDB, if so you can run `sudo apt-get install -f` to bring them in.

You'll probably want to store the data from the Mongo instance in the same drive you chose to store the blockchain data, due to the large amount of storage required. Set the directory for this by creating a `db` folder in the location you chose and run `mongod --dbpath ~/YOUR_LOCATION/db`

### On Windows:

Download and install MongoDB from https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community.

> NOTE: To view MongoDB files with a more approachable GUI, download and install MongoDB Compass: https://docs.mongodb.com/compass/master/install/

## 5. Configure & Build ION Microservices

Clone https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ion:
```
git clone https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ion
```

Example configuration files for both `testnet-` and `mainnet-` can be found under [the top-level `json/` directory](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ion/tree/master/json).

> NOTE: If not specified, **`json/testnet-*-*.json` files are used as default configuration values**. Be sure to start with whichever config template (`testnet-` or `mainnet-`) is right for your use case.

### Create your configuration files from templates

Copy the configuration files `<testnet-or-mainnet>-bitcoin-config.json` and `<testnet-or-mainnet>-bitcoin-versioning.json` to another directory, (e.g. `/etc/ion/`)

### Update configuration files

Update the ION Bitcoin microservice (e.g. `/etc/ion/testnet-bitcoin-config.json`):

  - `bitcoinPeerUri`
    - Ensure it points to the RPC endpoint of the Bitcoin Core client you setup earlier in this guide
     - testnet: `http://localhost:18332`
     - mainnet: `http://localhost:8332` (assuming default Bitcoin Core configuration from Step 2)
  - `bitcoinDataDirectory`
    - It needs to point to the block files folder:
     - testnet: `[datadir]/testnet3`.
     - mainnet: exactly the same as the `[datadir]` value configured for Bitcoin Core in Step 2.
  - `bitcoinWalletImportString`
    - if you intend to write DID operations, populate it with your private key, else use any [generated import string](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/wif) **without any bitcoin**
     - testnet: (a valid `testnet` example wallet will be generated each time `ion-bitcoin` fails to load a valid WIF string on startup as part of its error message. You can use one of those values for testing as well
     - mainnet: (must be a mainnet-compatible WIF)
  - `bitcoinRpcUsername` & `bitcoinRpcPassword`
    - must match what was set in `bitcoin.conf` from step 2.

Update the configuration for the ION core service under `json/testnet-core-config.json`:
  - `didMethodName`
    - testnet: `ion:test`
    - mainnet: `ion`

Run the following commands to build ION:
```
npm i
npm run build
```

> NOTE: You may nee to run `npm install tsc` before running `npm run build` to install TypeScript in Linux/Mac environments.

> NOTE: You **must rerun `npm run build`** every time a configuration JSON file is modified.


## 6. Run ION Bitcoin microservice

*Update the paths below* to where you editted and saved the config files from the previous step.

```
ION_BITCOIN_CONFIG_FILE_PATH=/etc/ion/testnet-bitcoin-config.json
ION_BITCOIN_VERSIONING_CONFIG_FILE_PATH=/etc/ion/testnet-bitcoin-versioning.json
npm run bitcoin
```

> NOTE: This service will fail to start until your Bitcoin Core client has blocks past the ION genesis block. Please wait and try again later if this happens.


## 7. Run ION core service

### (Optional) Create your configuration files from templates

> NOTE: This is not required when using `testnet` because the defaults are sufficient

Copy the configuration files `<testnet or mainnet>-core-config.json` and `<testnet or mainnet>-core-versioning.json` to another directory, (e.g. `/etc/ion/` or `~`)

Start a new console and run the following command to start the core service. 

On Windows
```
$Env:ION_CORE_CONFIG_FILE_PATH="\usr\local\src\ion\json\testnet-core-config.json"
$Env:ION_CORE_VERSIONING_CONFIG_FILE_PATH="\usr\local\src\ion\json\testnet-core-versioning.json"
```

On Linux
```
export ION_CORE_CONFIG_FILE_PATH=/usr/local/src/ion/json/testnet-core-config.json
export ION_CORE_VERSIONING_CONFIG_FILE_PATH=/usr/local/src/ion/json/testnet-core-versioning.json
npm run core
```

> NOTE: This service will fail to start until your ION Bitcoin service has started successfully.

Give it some time to synchronize ION transactions.

## 8. Verify ION is working properly

Check the following DID resolution in your browser:

 * testnet:
[http://localhost:3000/identifiers/did:ion:test:EiClWZ1MnE8PHjH6y4e4nCKgtKnI1DK1foZiP61I86b6pw](http://localhost:3000/identifiers/did:ion:test:EiClWZ1MnE8PHjH6y4e4nCKgtKnI1DK1foZiP61I86b6pw)
 * mainnet:
[http://localhost:3000/identifiers/did:ion:EiClkZMDxPKqC9c-umQfTkR8vvZ9JPhl_xLDI9Nfk38w5w](http://localhost:3000/identifiers/did:ion:EiClkZMDxPKqC9c-umQfTkR8vvZ9JPhl_xLDI9Nfk38w5w)
